# Vulnerability-Assesment
A vulnerability assessment is the testing process used to identify and assign severity levels to as many security defects as possible in a given timeframe. This process may involve automated and manual techniques with varying degrees of rigor and an emphasis on comprehensive coverage.

# Why need Vulnerability-Assesment?
Vulnerability assessments can identify vulnerabilities in software applications and systems that malware could exploit. By addressing these vulnerabilities, organizations can reduce the risk of malware infections and prevent potential damage to their IT infrastructure.

# Wireshark-Packet Capture:
Wireshark listens to a network connection in real time and then grabs entire streams of traffic â€“ quite possibly tens of thousands of packets at a time. Filtering: Wireshark is capable of slicing and dicing all of this random live data using filters.
