# Vulnerability-Assesment
A vulnerability assessment is the testing process used to identify and assign severity levels to as many security defects as possible in a given timeframe. This process may involve automated and manual techniques with varying degrees of rigor and an emphasis on comprehensive coverage.

# Why need Vulnerability-Assesment?
Vulnerability assessments can identify vulnerabilities in software applications and systems that malware could exploit. By addressing these vulnerabilities, organizations can reduce the risk of malware infections and prevent potential damage to their IT infrastructure.

# Acunetix Web Vulnerability Scanner: 
Acunetix has pioneered the web application security scanning technology: Its engineers have focused on web security as early as 1997 and developed an engineering lead in web site analysis and vulnerability detection.

# Acunetix Web Vulnerability Scanner includes many innovative features:

AcuSensor Technology
An automatic client script analyzer allowing for security testing of Ajax and Web 2.0 applications
Industries' most advanced and in-depth SQL injection and Cross site scripting testing
Advanced penetration testing tools, such as the HTTP Editor and the HTTP Fuzzer
Visual macro recorder makes testing web forms and password protected areas easy
Support for pages with CAPTHCA, single sign-on and Two Factor authentication mechanisms
Extensive reporting facilities including VISA PCI compliance reports
Multi-threaded and lightning fast scanner crawls hundreds of thousands of pages with ease

Acunetix crawls and analyzes websites including flash content, SOAP and AJAX
Port scans a web server and runs security checks against network services running on the server

# Wireshark-Packet Capture:
Wireshark listens to a network connection in real time and then grabs entire streams of traffic â€“ quite possibly tens of thousands of packets at a time. Filtering: Wireshark is capable of slicing and dicing all of this random live data using filters.
